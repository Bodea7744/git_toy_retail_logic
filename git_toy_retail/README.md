# 🧸 Collectible Toy Store Logic

This Python script simulates the logic behind a fictional toy store specializing in collectible items. It allows users to explore product options, manage an inventory system, add toys to a virtual shopping cart, and view a checkout summary. The application is structured through multiple classes to reflect modular and retail-based behavior.

## 📌 Key Features
- Uses object-oriented classes to organize retail logic
- Creates instances of collectible toys with attributes like name, category, rarity, and price
- Allows users to add toys to a virtual cart
- Calculates cart totals and prints item summaries
- Inventory manager class supports adding, viewing, and removing collectibles

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Custom classes: `CollectibleToy`, `ToyCart`, `InventoryManager`
- Arithmetic operations and string formatting
- Command-line output for simulation

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Open your terminal or code editor
3. Run the script using:

   `python toy_store_runner.py`

4. View the printed cart summary with items and total cost

## 💡 Skills Showcased
- Creating and interacting with Python classes
- Structuring logic into reusable components
- Using lists to manage collections of objects
- Formatting outputs for user readability
- Simulating real-world processes like adding/removing inventory items
