# 🧸 Git Toy Retail Project Logic

Welcome to **Git Toy Retail Logic**, a modular Python and Git-based repository showcasing object-oriented retail simulation and full version control documentation. From product management to Git operations, this repo combines practical coding with professional development tracking — ideal for educational purposes, portfolio highlights, or further expansion.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository captures both the core Python logic behind a collectible toy retail application and a complete Git workflow journey. Through individual `.py` modules and step-by-step Git screenshots, the project demonstrates version control mastery alongside clean object-oriented design.

It includes:
- Python implementation of retail concepts (inventory, cart, product)
- Git educational steps: init, branching, merge, conflict resolution, tagging, pushing
- Screenshot-based tracking of GitHub operations
- A unified and structured folder containing all key assets

## 🧩 Modules Included

Each folder represents a key component of the educational experience:

| 📁 Folder | 🔎 Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| `git-toy-retail/` | Contains the full retail application: Python classes and logic |
| `screenshots/` | Captures the full Git and GitHub workflow from start to release |
